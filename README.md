Database Systems - Fall 2023  
Original Code and files from course's final project.  
PokemonScrape collects data then cleans and organizes into dataframes representing different schema.  
The main datframe was broken down into separate schema to achieve 3NF.  
The dataframes were exported as csv files to convert them into the script, which was modified into the ddl.
